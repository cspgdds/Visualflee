# Visualflee

Flee, an agent model based tool being developed at Brunel, uses data from [United Nations High Commission for Refugees](http://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations) (UNHCR) about camps and data from the [Armed Conflicat Location & Event Data Project](http://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations) (ACLED) to model the migration of populations within a conflict zone. This project aims to automate the data acquisition that are used as the inputs to flee and visualise the outputs of Flee. Currently flee is closed source but it will be soon be made available under an open source licence.
