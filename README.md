# Visualflee

Flee, an agent model based simulation tool, developed by Groen (2016) at Brunel University London. It uses data from [United Nations High Commission for Refugees](http://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations) (UNHCR) about camps and data from the [Armed Conflicat Location & Event Data Project](http://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations) (ACLED) to model the migration of refugees within a conflict zone. This project aims to automate the data acquisition that are used as the inputs to Flee and visualise the outputs of Flee. Currently Flee is closed source but it will be soon be made available (after the first journal paper publication) under a BSD 3-clause licence.

The ultimate aim is to produce an interface of the type:
